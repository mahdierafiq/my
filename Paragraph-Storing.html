As the sun rises slowly, the world seems covered in a light blanket of fog, giving everything a misty appearance.

The fields and rooftops are often covered with dew, and sometimes a thin layer of glittering frost in the early morning makes the surroundings look very much magical.On a winter morning, the usual hustle and bustle of daily life starts a little later than usual. people prefer to stay warm in their beds for a while longer. The streets are silent, with fewer people outside .Those who come outside are often seen gathering around small fires to keep themselves warm. The smell of burning wood and the sight of people sipping hot tea or pithas (traditional winter snacks) is common.A winter morning is a beautiful time.
